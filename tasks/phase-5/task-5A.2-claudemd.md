# TASK 5A.2: CLAUDE.md Generator (Backend)
> Phase 5 — Brainstorm Wizard | Session A (Backend) | Depends on: Task 5A.1

## What to Build
Generate and maintain the CLAUDE.md project context file that AI agents read automatically. Must stay concise — under 200 lines target, 300 max.

## Key Size Rules
- Target: under 200 lines / ~4KB
- Only include system architecture diagram (not all 5)
- Max 5 completed tasks shown (rest: "...and N more")
- Max 5 queued tasks shown (rest: "...and N more")
- Max 5 convention bullets
- Task-specific diagrams injected via prompt, NOT into CLAUDE.md

## Separator Line
`---` separates Synk-managed content (above) from user content (below). Synk NEVER overwrites below the separator. On first generation, if CLAUDE.md already exists, preserve everything below separator.

## Auto-Update Triggers
| Trigger | What Updates |
|---------|-------------|
| Blueprint generated/edited | Architecture section |
| Task completed and merged | In Progress → Completed |
| New task dispatched | Added to In Progress |
| Task added to queue | Added to Queued |
| Agent dispatched | Full rewrite so agent has latest state |

## Deliverables
1. `claudemd_generator.rs` — generate(), update(), get_line_count()
2. Template rendering with live task status
3. Size enforcement: auto-trim when exceeding 300 lines
4. Separator preservation: detect ---, keep everything below
5. First-generation safety: handle existing CLAUDE.md gracefully

## Files to Create/Modify
```
src-tauri/src/core/claudemd_generator.rs (new)
```

## Acceptance Test
Generate CLAUDE.md → file under 200 lines. Add 20 completed tasks → only 5 shown + count. Edit manually below --- → regenerate → manual content preserved. Check: only 1 diagram included.

## SPEC REFERENCE (Read all of this carefully)
## 30. CLAUDE.md Generation

### 30.1 What is CLAUDE.md?

`CLAUDE.md` is a project context file that Claude Code reads automatically when it starts a session. It tells the AI agent everything it needs to know about the project — architecture, conventions, what's been done, what's in progress. Synk generates and maintains this file.

### 30.2 Generated File Structure

```markdown
# Project: {project_name}

## Overview
{project description from brainstorm wizard or user-provided}

## Tech Stack
{tech stack list from blueprint or config}

## Project Blueprint

### System Architecture
```mermaid
{architecture diagram mermaid source}
```

### File Structure
```mermaid
{file structure diagram mermaid source}
```

### Database Schema
```mermaid
{ER diagram mermaid source}
```

### API Routes
```mermaid
{API routes diagram mermaid source}
```

### Deployment
```mermaid
{deployment diagram mermaid source}
```

## Current Status

### Completed
- ✅ {task title} ({branch name}, merged)
- ✅ {task title} ({branch name}, merged)

### In Progress
- 🔵 {task title} — being worked on by {agent type} on branch `{branch}`
- 🔵 {task title} — being worked on by {agent type} on branch `{branch}`

### Queued
- ⬜ {task title}
- ⬜ {task title}

## Conventions
- Branch naming: `feat/{task-slug}`, `fix/{task-slug}`
- Commit style: conventional commits (feat:, fix:, chore:, etc.)
- Test files: colocated with source in `__tests__/` directories
- {any user-added conventions from .synk/config.json}

## Important Notes
- This file is auto-generated by Synk. Manual edits to the sections above
  will be overwritten. Add custom notes below the line.

---

{user's custom notes preserved here — Synk never overwrites below this line}
```

### 30.3 Size Constraints (Critical)

CLAUDE.md must stay concise to preserve agent context window for actual work. A bloated context file makes agents slower and less effective.

**Hard limits:**
- **Target size: under 200 lines / ~4KB**
- **Absolute max: 300 lines** — if file exceeds this, Synk auto-trims (see trimming rules below)

**Conciseness rules:**

| Section | Rule |
|---------|------|
| Overview | Max 2 sentences |
| Tech Stack | Bullet list, no descriptions — just names |
| Blueprint diagrams | Include ONLY the system architecture diagram (the most useful one). Other 4 diagrams stored in `.synk/blueprint.json` only — agents can request them if needed. |
| Current Status | Max 5 completed tasks shown (most recent). Older ones just show a count: "...and 12 more completed tasks" |
| In Progress | All shown (these are actively relevant) |
| Queued | Max 5 shown. Rest summarized: "...and 8 more queued" |
| Conventions | Max 5 bullet points |

**Trimming priority (when file exceeds 300 lines):**
1. First: reduce Completed list to 3 items + count
2. Then: reduce Queued list to 3 items + count  
3. Then: simplify architecture diagram (remove subgraph details)
4. Never trim: In Progress items, Conventions, user notes below separator

**Why only one diagram:** The system architecture diagram gives agents 80% of the context value. Including all 5 diagrams would easily push CLAUDE.md past 500 lines. The other diagrams are available on demand — an agent can read `.synk/blueprint.json` if it needs the DB schema or API routes for a specific task.

**Per-task context injection:** When dispatching a task, Synk appends a small task-specific block to the agent's prompt (NOT to CLAUDE.md) with the relevant diagram for that task:

```
Your current task: "Build user authentication"
Relevant schema for this task:
```mermaid
{ER diagram — only the relevant entities}
`` `
```

This keeps CLAUDE.md lean while still giving each agent the specific context it needs.

### 30.4 When CLAUDE.md Updates

| Trigger | What Updates |
|---------|-------------|
| Blueprint generated/edited | Architecture, file structure, DB, API, deployment sections |
| Task completed and merged | Moves from "In Progress" → "Completed" |
| New task dispatched | Added to "In Progress" with agent and branch info |
| Task added to queue | Added to "Queued" |
| User edits conventions | Conventions section updates |
| Agent dispatched to new session | Fresh CLAUDE.md write so agent has latest state |

### 30.5 The Separator Line

The `---` line near the bottom is critical. Everything above it is auto-managed by Synk. Everything below it is user-owned and never touched. This lets users add custom notes, coding standards, or context without worrying about Synk overwriting it.

**On first generation:** Synk checks if `CLAUDE.md` already exists. If it does:
1. Read the existing file
2. Look for the `---` separator
3. Preserve everything below the separator
4. Replace everything above with Synk's generated content
5. If no separator exists, append Synk's content above a new separator and move existing content below it

## 19. Mermaid Blueprint Generation — Prompt Templates

### 19.1 The Five Diagram Types

Each diagram type has a dedicated prompt template. The AI receives the full `ProjectBlueprint` JSON as context along with the template.

**Template 1: System Architecture**
```
Generate a Mermaid flowchart showing the system architecture.

REQUIREMENTS:
- Use `flowchart TD` (top-down layout)
- Group related components with `subgraph` blocks
  (e.g., "Frontend", "Backend", "Data Layer", "External Services")
- Show data flow direction with labeled arrows
- Include: UI components, API layer, business logic, databases,
  caches, message queues, external APIs, auth services
- Use icons in node labels where helpful: 🖥️ 🔌 🗄️ 💾 🔐

STYLE RULES:
- Node IDs: lowercase-kebab (e.g., auth-service)
- Node labels: Title Case with brief description
- Arrow labels: verb phrase (e.g., "queries", "authenticates via")
- Max 20 nodes (combine minor components)

RESPOND WITH ONLY VALID MERMAID SYNTAX.
```

**Template 2: File/Folder Structure**
```
Generate a Mermaid graph showing the project directory structure as a tree.

REQUIREMENTS:
- Use `graph TD` layout
- Root node = project name
- Show directories as rounded rectangles, files as plain rectangles
- Include: src/, config files, package manifests, test directories,
  public/static assets, CI/CD files
- Annotate key files with their purpose in parentheses
  e.g., "main.rs (entry point)"
- Depth: max 3 levels deep. Group deeper content as "..."
- Style directories differently: use `:::dir` class

RESPOND WITH ONLY VALID MERMAID SYNTAX.
```

**Template 3: Database Schema (ER Diagram)**
```
Generate a Mermaid ER diagram showing the database schema.

REQUIREMENTS:
- Use `erDiagram` syntax
- Include all entities identified in the project spec
- Show relationships with proper cardinality:
  ||--o{ (one to many), ||--|| (one to one), }o--o{ (many to many)
- Each entity must include: primary key, foreign keys, and 3-7
  most important fields with data types
- Use standard types: string, int, uuid, datetime, boolean, text, float
- Add relationship labels (e.g., "places", "belongs to", "has many")

RESPOND WITH ONLY VALID MERMAID SYNTAX.
```

**Template 4: API Routes**
```
Generate a Mermaid flowchart showing the API route structure.

REQUIREMENTS:
- Use `flowchart LR` (left-to-right layout)
- Group routes by resource with `subgraph` blocks
  (e.g., "/auth", "/users", "/products")
- Each node = one endpoint: "METHOD /path"
  e.g., "POST /auth/login"
- Color-code by HTTP method:
  - GET: green (:::get)
  - POST: blue (:::post)
  - PUT/PATCH: orange (:::put)
  - DELETE: red (:::delete)
- Show middleware/auth requirements as diamond decision nodes
- Include request/response summary on hover (title attribute)

RESPOND WITH ONLY VALID MERMAID SYNTAX.
```

**Template 5: Deployment Architecture**
```
Generate a Mermaid flowchart showing the deployment and infrastructure.

REQUIREMENTS:
- Use `flowchart TD` layout
- Show: developer machine, CI/CD pipeline, staging, production
- Include: version control (GitHub/GitLab), build steps, testing,
  container registry, hosting platform, CDN, DNS, monitoring
- Show deployment flow with numbered arrows (1. push, 2. build, etc.)
- Include environment variables / secrets management
- Show scaling strategy if applicable (load balancer, replicas)

RESPOND WITH ONLY VALID MERMAID SYNTAX.
```

### 19.2 Validation & Error Recovery

After receiving Mermaid source from the AI:
1. **Syntax validation**: Run through `mermaid.parse()` on the frontend
2. **If invalid**: Send back to AI with the error message: `"The Mermaid syntax had an error: {error}. Fix it and return the corrected version."`
3. **Max 3 retry attempts** before showing the raw source in the editor for manual fixing
4. **Fallback**: If AI consistently fails on a diagram type, show a template skeleton the user can fill in manually

### 19.3 Live Node Status Updates (Existing Projects)

Once a project is active in the workspace, the Mermaid planner becomes a **live dashboard**. Each node in the architecture diagram can be linked to a task:

```typescript
interface MermaidNodeBinding {
  nodeId: string;          // "auth-service" from the diagram
  taskId: string | null;   // linked task in the task queue
  status: 'not_started' | 'in_progress' | 'done' | 'failed';
}
```

The floating Mermaid panel applies CSS classes to nodes based on status:
- `not_started`: default styling (gray border)
- `in_progress`: pulsing blue border + 🔵 badge
- `done`: green border + ✅ badge
- `failed`: red border + ❌ badge

Binding is manual: user right-clicks a node → "Link to task" → picks from task queue. This keeps it simple and avoids brittle auto-matching.

### 19.4 Blueprint as Agent Context (Critical Requirement)

When an agent is dispatched to a task, Synk **always injects the relevant Mermaid blueprint** into the agent's context so the agent understands where its work fits in the bigger picture. This happens automatically — the user doesn't need to do anything.

**Injection methods (by agent type):**

| Agent | How Blueprint is Provided |
|-------|--------------------------|
| Claude Code | Written into the project's `CLAUDE.md` file under a `## Project Blueprint` section. Claude Code reads this automatically. |
| Gemini CLI | Prepended to the task prompt as a context block. |
| Codex | Included in the system prompt or project context file. |
| Plain Terminal | Not applicable (no AI to consume it). |

**What's included in CLAUDE.md (always present):**
- The system architecture diagram ONLY (gives the big picture without bloating the file)

**What's injected per-task via prompt (not in CLAUDE.md):**
- The specific diagram layer most relevant to the task (e.g., database schema if the task is "build the user model")
- A note highlighting which node(s) in the architecture diagram this task corresponds to
- Current status of related nodes (so the agent knows what's already done vs. pending)

This split keeps CLAUDE.md under 200 lines while still giving each agent targeted context for its specific task.

**When blueprints update:** If the user edits a diagram while agents are working, Synk updates the `CLAUDE.md` / context file. Agents pick up changes on their next prompt cycle.

This ensures every agent works with architectural awareness, not in isolation. The blueprint is the single source of truth for how the project fits together.
